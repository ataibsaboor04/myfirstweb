	<h2 id="web">Web Development</h2>

		<p title="Web Development" contenteditable>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>

		<p title="Web Development">Every Web Developer must have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Responsive Web Design is used in all types of modern web development. When you feel comfortable with HTML and CSS, it is time to dig deeper. You should learn how to use Maps, Fonts and Icons in HTML. On the JavaScript side, you should learn how to access the HTML DOM. You should also learn how to use AJAX and JSON for making server requests.</p>

		<h3>Frameworks</h3>
			<p>Now it is time to look at some Frameworks. On the CSS side you should choose a framework for reponsive web design: Bootstrap  /  Material Design  /  W3.CSS. On the JavaScript side you should learn at least one modern framework: React.js  /  Angular.js  /  Vue.js   /  W3.JS. Maybe the popularity of jQuery has passed the top, but it is still the most used JavaScript framework.</p>

	<h2 id="html">HTML</h2>

		<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <!-- <input /> --> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

	<h2 id="css">CSS</h2>

		<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>

	<h2 id="node">Node.js</h2>

		<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.</p>

	<h2 id="django">Django</h1>

		<p>Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, an American indeppendent organization established as a 501 non-profit.</p>
